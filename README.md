Students that use eCampus also known as "instructure" will be able to customize their website, apart from allowing them to instantly copy file URLs. Also useful for teachers to share files very fast by just sending it in the meeting's class.

# Before starting...
This code/script/project uses cookies to save information across different pages. To not show the tutorial twice, to save what style you'd like to keep, and/or keep the custom logo. And I am not responsible if this code is edited for malicious porpouses. 

# How to get started
To use `idl` you will need an extension called **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)**. This will allow you to run this script in every page in eCampus, without the need to input the script inside the console every time you'd like to use.

Once **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)** is installed you to **[click this link](http://js-scripts.neutronx.rf.gd/idl.user.js)** which will open **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)** with the option to install it. Click the **`Install`** button. and the script will be installed. If not copy the content of `idl.user.js` into a new Once **[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)** script.

# Get Started
Once you log in into eCampus the script will pop-up an introduction (only once, unless cookies are deleted) there it explains the **Instant Download Links**. A new option will appear on the side bar. When you click on it a menu will appear, and you can use the features It has. For example the bootstrap re-design, or the custom logo.
